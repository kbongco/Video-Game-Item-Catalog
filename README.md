<h1>Item Catalog</h1> 
This is the second project in Udacity's Full Stack Web developer Nanodegree. In this project, we 
would be developing a web application that provides a list of various items, in this case video
games, that provides a list of it and its catagories. The categories each game will be divided into are based on platforms/consoles, each game will contain the title, a brief description, as well as the year it was released.  This will be built using Flask.
